 * exactly the way we need it to be.
 *
 * To display this example on a page, you will first need to instantiate the class,
 * then call $yourInstance->prepare_items() to handle any data manipulation, then
 * finally call $yourInstance->display() to render the table to the page.

 * Our topic for this list table is going to be movies.

	 * be used. Generally, you should try to use custom column methods as much as

	 * need to concern itself with any column with a name of 'title'. Instead, it
