/*************************** LOAD THE BASE CLASS *******************************
 *******************************************************************************
 * The WP_List_Table class isn't automatically available to plugins, so we need
 * to check if it's available and load it if necessary. In this tutorial, we are
 * going to use the WP_List_Table class directly from WordPress core.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * Please note that the WP_List_Table class technically isn't an official API,
 * and it could change at some point in the distant future. Should that happen,
 * I will update this plugin with the most current techniques for your reference
 * immediately.
 *
 * If you are really worried about future compatibility, you can make a copy of
 * the WP_List_Table class (file path is shown just below) to use and distribute
 * with your plugins. If you do that, just remember to change the name of the
 * class to avoid conflicts with core.
 *
 * Since I will be keeping this tutorial up-to-date for the foreseeable future,
 * I am going to work with the copy of the class provided in WordPress core.

/************************** CREATE A PACKAGE CLASS *****************************
 *******************************************************************************
 * Create a new list table package that extends the core WP_List_Table class.
 * WP_List_Table contains most of the framework for generating the table, but we
 * need to define and override some methods so that our data can be displayed
 * exactly the way we need it to be.
 * 
 * To display this example on a page, you will first need to instantiate the class,
 * then call $yourInstance->prepare_items() to handle any data manipulation, then
 * finally call $yourInstance->display() to render the table to the page.
 * 
 * Our theme for this list table is going to be movies.

 * are often times where you may need to include logic here between those steps,
 * so we've instead called those methods explicitly. It keeps things flexible, and
 * it's the way the list tables are used in the WordPress core.
